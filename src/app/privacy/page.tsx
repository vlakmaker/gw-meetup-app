        <p className="mb-6">
          Claude Connect (&ldquo;the App&rdquo;) is a personal, open-source hobby project built to
          help attendees of the Claude Code Meetup Singapore connect with each other. It is not
          affiliated with Anthropic. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">What we collect</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Authentication data:</strong> When you sign in using Google, GitHub, or a magic
          link, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture (where available) from the
          provider you choose. If you sign in via magic link, we collect only the email address you
          provide.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Profile data you provide:</strong> During onboarding you may provide your name,
          job title/role, interest tags, what you&rsquo;re looking for, a description of something
          you&rsquo;ve built, an AI profile snippet, your LinkedIn URL, and an optional profile
          photo. You also control whether your email is shared with mutual connections and whether
          your name is searchable.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Interaction data:</strong> The App records waves (interest signals) you send to
          other users, mutual connections formed, and beacon presence signals you choose to activate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-900">How we use your information</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your information is used only to operate the App &mdash; specifically to let you sign in,
          build your profile, discover and connect with other attendees, and participate in live
          beacon features. We do not sell, rent, share, or trade your personal data for advertising,
          analytics, or any commercial purpose.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To suggest relevant connections, parts of your profile (role, interest tags, what
          you&rsquo;re looking for, and optionally your AI profile snippet and project description)
          are sent to the Anthropic API (Claude) for match scoring and title generation. This data
          is processed in accordance with{" "}
